            <p>In the left photo we have the wireframe of dashboard page and in the right
                we have the skatch. <br>
                The skatch has the title in the left of navigation bar and the welcome message,
                the left-side navigation,
                the presentation card that contains a title (Dashboard), some dashboard cards with the title of the corresponding page and the 
                number of table's rows.

                The skatch of products page has a card that contains the title of page, a horrizontal bar, 
                add (row to products table) and search options, a table with data.

            <p>To get the Products page, in the dashboard we click products from the left-side navigation bar or "View products"
                of the dashboard-card that has the "Products" title.

        <h2>Minimum 3 real examples concerning the QOC (Questions, Options, Criteria) method.
        These examples could also give the motivation for choosing a certain idea/concept.</h2>
        <p>
            In the first image, we can see that the "Add" button is under horrizontal bar of the presentation card.<br>
            In the second image, we see that "+" sign at the bottom of the table.<br>
            In the third image, the "Add" button is at the bottom of the presentation card.<br>
            The first image has the better option because we can see very fast the add button there.<br>
            In case we have many rows in the table and we don't have a pagination, it's not ok to the Add button
            to be at the bottom.
